O their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\\r\\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\\r\\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,\\xe2\\x80\\x94marry, she had a better love to\\r\\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\\r\\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\\r\\nRomeo, bonjour! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a French salutation to your French slop. You\\r\\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\\r\\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\\r\\nin the hams.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nMeaning, to curtsy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA most courteous exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nPink for flower.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nRight.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\\r\\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\\r\\nwearing, solely singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll cry a match.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\\r\\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\\r\\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\\r\\ngoose.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nNay, good goose, bite not.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\\r\\nell broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\\r\\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\\r\\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\\r\\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\r\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nStop there, stop there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\r\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goodly gear!\\r\\nA sail, a sail!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nMy fan, Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the fairer face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs it good-den?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\r\\nprick of noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\r\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\r\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\r\\nfault of a worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYou say well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\xe2\\x80\\x99faith; wisely, wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat hast thou found?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\r\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n    An old hare hoar,\\r\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\r\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\r\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\r\\n    Is too much for a score\\r\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\r\\nRomeo, will you come to your father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\r\\nropery?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\r\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take him down, and a were lustier\\r\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find those\\r\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\r\\nhis skains-mates.\\xe2\\x80\\x94And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\r\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\r\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\r\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\r\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\r\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\r\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paradise, as they\\r\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\r\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\r\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\r\\nvery weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\nthee,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGood heart, and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\r\\nbe a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\r\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nBid her devise\\r\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\r\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cell\\r\\nBe shriv\\xe2\\x80\\x99d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\r\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll quit thy pains;\\r\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat say\\xe2\\x80\\x99st thou, my dear Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er hear say,\\r\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI warrant thee my man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When \\xe2\\x80\\x99twas a\\r\\nlittle prating thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x94O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\r\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\r\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\r\\nParis is the properer man, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\r\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\r\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAh, mocker! That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name. R is for the\\xe2\\x80\\x94no, I know it begins\\r\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\r\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAy, a thousand times.

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so.\\r\\nO, she is lame. Love\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heralds should be thoughts,\\r\\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beams,\\r\\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\\r\\nTherefore do nimble-pinion\\xe2\\x80\\x99d doves draw love,\\r\\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\r\\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\\r\\nOf this day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey, and from nine till twelve\\r\\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\\r\\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\\r\\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be as swift in motion as a ball;\\r\\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\r\\nAnd his to me.\\r\\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\\r\\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\\r\\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter, stay at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Peter._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNow, good sweet Nurse,\\xe2\\x80\\x94O Lord, why look\\xe2\\x80\\x99st thou sad?\\r\\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\\r\\nIf good, thou sham\\xe2\\x80\\x99st the music of sweet news\\r\\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\\r\\nFie, how my bones ache!

Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\\r\\nout of breath?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\\r\\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\\r\\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\r\\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\r\\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\\r\\nSay either, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay the circumstance.\\r\\nLet me be satisfied, is\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good or bad?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\r\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, yet his\\r\\nleg excels all men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\r\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\r\\nflower of courtesy, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\r\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\r\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\r\\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\r\\nMy back o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 t\\xe2\\x80\\x99other side,\\xe2\\x80\\x94O my back, my back!\\r\\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\\r\\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\r\\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\\r\\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\\r\\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,\\xe2\\x80\\x94Where is your mother?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\\r\\nWhere should she be?

The sweetest honey\\r\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\r\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\nWill ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\r\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\r\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\nBe heap\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tongue\\r\\nUnfold the imagin\\xe2\\x80\\x99d happiness that both\\r\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\r\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\r\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.

Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\r\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\r\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\r\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\r\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\r\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\r\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\r\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\r\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\r\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\r\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe fee simple!

What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\r\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my fiddlestick, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\r\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nMen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\nI will not budge for no man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleasure, I.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\r\\nMarry, go before to field, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be your follower;\\r\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\r\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know\\xe2\\x80\\x99st me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI do protest I never injur\\xe2\\x80\\x99d thee,\\r\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\r\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\r\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\r\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\r\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\r\\nof the eight.

Marry, \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis enough.\\r\\nWhere is my page?

Then comes she to me,\\r\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\r\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\r\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\r\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\r\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\r\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\r\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\r\\nTo help to take her from her borrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99d grave,\\r\\nBeing the time the potion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s force should cease.\\r\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\r\\nWas stay\\xe2\\x80\\x99d by accident; and yesternight\\r\\nReturn\\xe2\\x80\\x99d my letter back.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'}"
